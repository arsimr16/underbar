# underbar
This is a project I completed as part of the precourse material for [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).  For this project I reimplemented the following functions from [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org) without using built-in JS functions (forEach, map, reduce, filter, etc.):
* identity
* first
* last
* each
* indexOf
* filter
* reject
* uniq
* map
* pluck
* reduce
* contains
* every
* some
* extend
* defaults
* once
* memoize
* delay
* shuffle
* invoke
